# NGSIM US-101 Dataset Smoothing

### Description

*NGSIM US-101 Dataset Smothing* provides a less-noisy and smoothed version of the well known trajectory NGSIM US-101 dataset using **[Savitzky-Golay Filter](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.16.1/reference/generated/scipy.signal.savgol_filter.html)**. The Smoothing is done as a two step process which is composed of first, smothing the X and Y values, then recomputing velocities and acceleration with respect to the smoothed X, Y values.

### About The NGSIM US-101 Dataset
The NGSIM US 101 datatset has been the ultimate open source dataset for trajectory prediction for researchers since its release in 2005. Many Researchers including [1-3] have pointed out the presence of noise in the dataset, mainly due to the fact that it has been automatically extracted from video recordings of 8 cameras mounted over buildings overlooking the Hollywood Freeway, in Los Angeles, CA, also known as southbound US 101. The software used for the extraction of the NGSIM US-101 dataset is called, In addition, the NGSIM documentation explicitly says: 

> <span style="color:red"> no accuracy assessment has been performed for the data set

may be gaps in the data provided </span>

### Smoothing approach:
1.	Smooth positions, then differentiate velocities and acceleration
2.	Differentiate velocities and accelerations, then smooth all three variables
3.	Smooth positions, differentiate velocities, smooth velocities, differentiate acceleration, smooth acceleration
